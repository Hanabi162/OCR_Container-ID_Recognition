# Container ID Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is a foundational implementation for recognizing container IDs using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It employs the PaddleOCR library and includes various image processing techniques to enhance detection accuracy.

## Features
- **OCR Processing**: Utilizes PaddleOCR for efficient text detection from images.
- **Image Pre-processing**: Implements functions for rotating, denoising, sharpening, and adjusting brightness of images to optimize OCR results.
- **Validation Rules**: Applies specific rules to validate recognized container IDs, ensuring they meet expected formats.
- **Customizable Parameters**: The `parameters.py` file allows you to easily modify image processing settings to better suit your requirements.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Update the image path in the code to point to your image file.
3. Run the script to process the image and retrieve container IDs.

## Customization
This project serves as a base for further development. Feel free to modify, extend, or integrate this code into your applications to improve accuracy or adapt it to different scenarios. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
